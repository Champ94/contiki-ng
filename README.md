# 2021 Update - Archiving
We stopped working on the project, therefore we are no longer mantaining the drivers/changes contained in thi repo. Archiving.

# Mitreo project 2018/2019 notes - Politecnico di Milano
We developed a new board for the platform srf06-cc26xx, named launchpad-bp (bp stands for BoosterPack).
It can be found at arch/platform/srf06-cc26xx/launchpad-bp/. The only board supported as of now is TI CC1350.

Drivers for BOSCH sensors are from the producer (https://github.com/BoschSensortec), updated to february 2018.
Drivers for TI sensors (temperature and optical) are based on the ones for TI SensorTag (arch/platform/simplelink/cc13xx-cc26xx/sensortag/).

The code is updated to the latest stable version of Contiki-NG, version 4.2 at the time of writing (commit 7b076e4af14b2259596f6d3765105d0593ae5257).

Examples for each sensor and a demo of the application with further instructions can be found on the examples folder under platform-specific/cc1350-bp.

### List of changes
#### Transmission frequency
To send data between different devices we use the 433Mhz frequency, it isnâ€™t enabled in Contiki-NG by default. In order to change it one need to set the following define in any config.h header

```
DOT_15_4G_CONF_FREQUENCY_BAND_ID id
```

id can be found in arch/cpu/cc26xx-cc13xx/rf-core/dot-15-4g.h

#### Sensors
In order to use sensors with the CC1350 LaunchPad we need to import the following files

##### Hardware Configurations

The following configurations allow the communication between senors boosterpack and board CC1350

 |              | TMP007 | OPT3001 | BME280 | BMI160 |
 | -------------|--------|---------|--------|--------|
 | HW Protocol  |  I2C   | I2C     | I2C    |I2C     |

 ##### BME280 Configuration
 
 The following configurations describe the mode of sampling of bme280. Others can be found in the official Bosch datasheet 
 and modified in arch/platform/srf06-cc26xx/launchpad-bp/bme280.c at function configure
 
  | Settings               | Value

  | Notes                  | In order to save clock cicle and energy it's better use 32 bit encoding data                                     |
